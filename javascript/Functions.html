    <!-- 1) Function Declaration
    A function declaration defines a function with a specified name and parameters. The function can then be called by
    its name.

    Here is an example of a function declaration:
    javascript
    function addNumbers(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    }
    
    In this example, the function `addNumbers` is declared with two parameters, `a` and `b`. The function adds these two
    numbers and returns the result.


    2) Function Expression
    A function expression defines a function as an expression. This means that the function can be defined within
    another expression or statement.

    Here is an example of a function expression:
    javascript
    const addNumbers = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    };

    In this example, the function `addNumbers` is defined as a constant variable. The function takes two parameters, `a`
    and `b`, and returns the sum of these two numbers.

    3) Arrow Functions

    Arrow functions are a more concise way to write function expressions. They were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
    Here is an example of an arrow function:
    javascript
    const addNumbers = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
    };
     In this example, the function `addNumbers` is defined as an arrow function with two parameters, `a` and `b`. The
    function returns the sum of these two numbers.

    4) Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

    An IIFE is a function expression that is executed immediately after it is defined.

    Here is an example of an IIFE:


    javascript
    (function() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
    })();
    ​


    In this example, the function is defined within parentheses and is immediately executed by the trailing parentheses.
    The function logs "Hello, World!" to the console.

    5) Callback Functions

    A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the other
    function has completed its execution.

    Here is an example of a callback function:


    javascript
    function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
    ​
    function processUserInput(callback) {
    const name = prompt("Please enter y ");-->
